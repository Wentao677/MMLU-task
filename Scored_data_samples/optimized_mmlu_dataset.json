This extension has degree [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = [sqrt(2), sqrt(3)] = 4. ки\nStep 2: Since sqrt(18) is in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), we can find its minimal polynomial over Q.

We can combine sqrt(3) and sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) into a single element, which is sqrt(6), to make it Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(6)). ки\nStep 3: The field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(6)) has already been simplified, so now we need to determine its degree over Q. To do this, we need to find the smallest possible polynomial equation with rational coefficients that has sqrt(2) and sqrt(6) as its roots. ки\nStep 4: We can use the fact that a polynomial equation in Q[x] of smallest degree that has a given root is the irreducible polynomial associated with that root. For example, the irreducible polynomial for sqrt(2) is x - sqrt(2), and the irreducible polynomial for sqrt(6) is x^2 - 6. ки\nStep 5: To find the irreducible polynomial for sqrt(6), we can start with (x - sqrt(6))(x + sqrt(6)), which simplifies to x^2 - 6.

Note that sqrt(18) is equal to sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9) = sqrt(2)*3 (since 9 is a perfect square). ки\nStep 2: Since Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is already a proper subset of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(2)*3) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3), we can simplify the field extension to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3). ки\nStep 3: Now, let's find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)). We know that (x-sqrt(3)) is a irreducible polynomial in Q[x], so its minimal polynomial over Q(sqrt(2)) is (x-sqrt(3)) or equivalently, x^2 - 3 since sqrt(2) is in the ring Q(sqrt(2)). ки\nStep 4: Similarly, we can find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q(sqrt(3)) by noting that (x-sqrt(2)) is also an irreducible polynomial in Q[x]. Therefore, its minimal polynomial over Q(sqrt(3)) is also x^2 - 2. ки\nStep 5: Now, we have the basis of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3) over Q as {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3}. However, this basis is not as nice as the usual basis {1, sqrt(2), i, 3} since sqrt(3) is not necessarily being a degree 1 element. ки\nStep 6: To obtain a nicer basis, we introduce the constant c = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), which is in the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3). Since c^2 = 2*3 = 6, we have that c = ±sqrt(6). However, since c = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), we can see that c = sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), so c = sqrt(6) is in Q(sqrt(3)). ки\nStep 7: Now, we have a new basis as {1, sqrt(2), c=sqrt(6), 3} for the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3) over Q.

Let's express the given elements as rational multiples of existing powers of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(18) = sqrt(2*3*3) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3*3) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9) = 3*sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the elements in the field extension are sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and 3*sqrt(2). ки\nStep 2: Identify the minimal polynomial for each element. The minimal polynomial of an element alpha over a field is the monic irreducible polynomial having alpha as a root.\n\nMineral polynomial for sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, as (x - sqrt(2)) gives 2 when evaluated at x = sqrt(2).\n\nMineral polynomial for sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3, as (x - sqrt(3)) gives 3 when evaluated at x = sqrt(3).\n\nMineral polynomial for 3*sqrt(2) over Q is (x - 3*sqrt(2))^2 = (x^2 - 2*3*3) = x^2 - 6. Here, the exponent 2 accounts for the repeated root. ки\nStep 3: Find the intersection of the minimal polynomials. The intersection of two polynomial p(x) = 0 and q(x) = 0 gives the values of x where both p(x) = q(x) = 0. We will use this to find the intersection of the minimal polynomials.\n\nFor the roots of x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, we have:\n\nx^2 - 2 = 0 --> x = ±sqrt(2)\nx^2 - 3 = 0 --> x = ±sqrt(3)\n\nFor the root of x^2 - 6, we have:\n\nx^2 - 6 = 0 --> x = ±sqrt(6)\n\nNote that sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are distinct and not equal to sqrt(6). So, we have no repeated roots or intersection of the minimal polynomials. However, sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) do intersect, which means the elements are algebraically dependent. ки\nStep 4: Calculate the degree of the field extension. In any extension, the degree [K:Q] is the number of distinct linearly independent elements. For K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)), we have three distinct elements.\n\nAs these elements are algebraically dependent, we can write each element in terms of the other two using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. To demonstrate this, let's rewrite 3*sqrt(2) in terms of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3):\n\n3*sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)\n\nSo, we can represent the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) with just two independent elements, sqrt(2), and sqrt(3).\n\nThe degree [K:Q] is the number of distinct linearly independent elements, which is 2. Since sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both quadratic in Q, we have quadratic extensions. For two quadratic extensions, the degree is calculated as the least common multiple (LCM) of the degrees. The LCM of 2 and 2 (both are quadratic) is 2.\n\nIn this case, the degree [K:Q] = 2, but the problem asks for the degree of the field extension consisting of sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and 3*sqrt(2). Since 3*sqrt(2) is also algebraically dependent, the correct degree of the field extension is the LCM of the degrees of the three quadratic extensions.\n\nAs both extensions are quadratic, the LCM is still 2. However, the degree of the entire extension is not just 2 because we need to account for the extra factor of 3. This is because the extension has three elements, and each element is multiplied by 1, 3, or sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the correct degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is the LCM of the degrees multiplied by 3, giving us 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe answer is D.",

So, p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = (1, 3, 5) in S_5. ки\nStep 4: To find the index of <p>, we can simply calculate the order of <p>. Since the order of (1, 3, 5) is 3, the index of <p> is 3! = 6. ки\nStep 5: Since 6 is not present in the options, we cannot select it as the correct answer. However, the correct answer could be the permutations which are multiples of 6. We can immediately notice that 120 = 5! is the first multiple of 6 which is not less than 5!. ки\nStep 6: Therefore, the index of <p> in S_5 is 6. Hence, the correct answer is D, which is 120.",

Notice that 2x^3 + x + 3 is equivalent to (2x + 1)(x^2 - x + 3) (by polynomial remainder theorem), so we can factor it as (x - 4)(x^2 + 2). Since x - 4 is a solution, we find its conjugate x = 1. ки\nStep 4: Combine the results. So far, we have found the zeros x = 0 and x = 4. Since these are all the solutions to the polynomial, the answer is the set of all these zeros, which is {0, 4}. However, since the answer choices do not include {0, 4}, we need to check the rest of the possible zeros. From the factorization, we have (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 4). Notice that 1 is a zero that we haven't counted yet. So, the correct answer is B. 1.",

In this case, we can try to factor the polynomial as (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)(x - e) with a, b, c, d, e in Z_5.

Simplifying the given polynomial, we get:\nx^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x = x + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x ки\nStep 2: Now, we can try to factor the polynomial:\nx^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x = (x + 1)(...)(...) ки\nStep 3: Our goal is to extend the polynomial by multiplying it with an appropriate polynomial from Z_5 that when combined with (x + 1) leaves a factor of (x - 4) or (x - 4) since 4 is the order of the finite field Z_5. We should use the easiest way: \"Polynomial long division\" to find the factor.\nApplying long division, we have:\nx + 1 | x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x (mod 5)\n------------------------------------------------\nx^4 + x^3 + 1\n\nDivide with remainder: -2\n\nSo we have: x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x = (x + 1)(x^4 + x^3 + 1) - 2 ки\nStep 4: Compute the discriminant (Δ) for the quadrature polynomial x^4 + x^3 + 1.\nΔ = [(1)^2 - 4 * 1 * (- 1)] = 4 ≠ 0\nΔ is not a perfect square. ки\nStep 5: The SZ's case: either no real solutions or two complex solutions.\n         We can calculate the roots of the quadratic equation: x^2 + x + 1 using the quadratic formula x = (-(-1 ± sqrt(α)))/2, where α = Δ = 1.

Therefore, we must consider all roots of this equation s.

We need to show that the factor group G/H is non-Abelian. ки\nStep 2: Let a and b be elements of G such that a ≠ e and b ≠ e, where e is the identity element of G.

This can be shown to be a group under the operation of coset multiplication.\n\nSince G is non-Abelian, there exist elements a, b in G such that ab ≠ ba. Then a and b do not commute with each other in the group G. However, in the factor group G/N, the cosets of N containing a and b can be represented by aN and bN, respectively. The product of these cosets is (aN)(bN) = abN.\n\nNow, abN ≠ baN, since a and b do not commute in the original group G. Hence, aN and bN do not commute with each other in the group G/N. Therefore, the factor group G/N is also non-Abelian. ки\nStep 2: Statement 2 | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTo prove this statement, let K be a normal subgroup of H, and let H be a normal subgroup of G. Then K is normal in H means that for any element h in H and any element k in K, hk = kh. Similarly, H is normal in G means that for any element g in G and any element h in H, gh = hg.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G, we can write g = h1h2, where h1 and h2 are elements of H.

This means that the group operation ∗ is not commutative, i.e., there exist elements a and b in G such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a. ки\nStep 2: Let H be a subgroup of G and K be a normal subgroup of H, i.e., K is a normal subgroup of G. This means that for any element k in K and any element h in H, hk = kh. ки\nStep 3: We want to find the factor group G/K. This is the set of cosets {aK | a in G} with the operation of juxtaposition. Specifically, for any two cosets aK and bK, their product is defined as (aK)(bK) = abK. ки\nStep 4: The set G/K forms a group under the given operation. The identity element is the coset eK, and for any coset aK, its inverse is a^(-1)K. ки\nStep 5: Consider the cosets aK and bK. Since H is a subgroup of G, aH ∩ bH is non-empty. Choose an element c in aH ∩ bH. ки\nStep 6: Since K is a normal subgroup of H, cK = KC (this means the coset cK is equal to the coset KC). ки\nStep 7: Now, we have aK = cH and bK = cH. Therefore, the product (aK)(bK) = (cH)(cH) = c(HK) = cK = KC. ки\nStep 8: Since cK = KC, the product (aK)(bK) = KC is actually a specific coset contained within the set KC. But, by definition, the set G/K is a group, and hence the set of cosets {aK | a in G} is a set partition of G. Therefore, we can write (aK)(bK) = KK'. ки\nStep 9: Since cc' = e, we have eK = a'^(-1)K. Therefore, (aK)(bK) = KK' = eK = a'^(-1)K. ки\nStep 10: Since the coset aK is equal to a'^(-1)K, the corresponding mapping ψ: G → G/K defined by ψ(a) = aK sends a to the coset aK. ки\nStep 11: By the definition of a factor group, ψ is a homomorphism, i.e., ψ(ab) = ψ(a)ψ(b) = aKbK = abK. Therefore, the factor group G/K is isomorphic to G/H. ки\nStep 12: Since G is non-Abelian, there are elements a and b in G such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a. Applying the homomorphism ψ, we have ψ(ab) ≠ ψ(ba). This means that (aK)(bK) ≠ (bK)(aK) in the factor group G/K.

Since H is a normal subgroup of G, ghg^(−1) in H. Hence, ghg^(−1)k = kh (by the assumption that K is a normal subgroup of H). ки\nStep 4: Note that (ghg^(−1))k = gkhg^(−1) = g(kh)g^(−1) ∈ H (by the assumption that H is a normal subgroup of G). ки\nStep 5: Since H is a group, we know that H is closed under the operation. Therefore, gkhg^(−1) is in H. ки\nStep 6: Hence, we have kh = ghg^(−1)k = gkhg^(−1) ∈ H, which shows that gk = kg. ки\nStep 7: Since g is an arbitrary element in G, we can conclude that K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nConclusion: Statement 2 is also true.\n\nThe answer is indeed C, True, False.",

A factor group is a quotient group, which is a group obtained by dividing a larger group by a normal subgroup. ки\nStep 2: If the original group is non-Abelian, that means it does not satisfy the commutative property, i.e., for any two elements a and b in the group, ab ≠ ba in general. ки\nStep 3: Now, let's consider the factor group G/N, where N is a normal subgroup of G. The elements of the factor group are equivalence classes of G, where each equivalence class is a set of elements in G that are congruent modulo N. ки\nStep 4: The operation in the factor group is the equivalence class of a+b, where a and b are elements in G, and a and b are in the same equivalence class. This operation is well-defined because of the normality of N. ки\nStep 5: Because the original group G is non-Abelian, there exist elements a and b such that ab ≠ ba. This means that the equivalence class [a] + [b] ≠ [b] + [a] in the factor group G/N. ки\nStep 6: This means that the factor group G/N is also non-Abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is TRUE.\n\n**Statement 2:** If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. ки\nStep 1: Let K be a normal subgroup of H, and H be a normal subgroup of G. ки\nStep 2: Then, for any element g in G, the left and right cosets ghK and gH are defined. ки\nStep 3: Since H is normal in G, ghK = gHK for any g in G.

        "text": "Here is the explanation:\n\nStatement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nStep 1: Define a factor group. A factor group, or quotient group, is a group obtained by dividing a larger group, G, by a normal subgroup, K. ки\nStep 2: Let G be a non-Abelian group. Then, G has a finite number of elements that do not commute with each other. ки\nStep 3: Consider a normal subgroup K of G. By definition, K is closed under the operation of G, meaning that for any a, b in K, a ∘ b is also in K. ки\nStep 4: Consider a, b in K. Since K is a normal subgroup, α ∘ (b) = (α) ∘ b for any α in G. ки\nStep 5: Since G is non-Abelian, there exists an α and β in G such that α ∘ β ≠ β ∘ α. ки\nStep 6: Consider (b)^(−1) ∘ (a) in the factor group G/K. We can write this as (b^(−1) ∘ a)K. ки\nStep 7: Using step 4, we can rewrite this as ((b^(−1)) ∘ (a))K = (a)K ∘ (b)^(-1)K. ки\nStep 8: Since G/K is a group, this means that (a)K ∘ (b)^(-1)K is an element in G/K. ки\nStep 9: Since K is a normal subgroup, we can commute the elements in this expression. This gives us (a)K ∘ (b)^(-1)K = ((a)K) ∘ ((b)^(-1)K). ки\nStep 10: Since (a)K = aK and (b)^(-1)K = b^(-1)K, this becomes aK ∘ b^(-1)K. ки\nStep 11: Since G is non-Abelian, aK and b^(-1)K do not commute, so aK ∘ b^(-1)K ≠ b^(-1)K ∘ aK. ки\nStep 12: Therefore, the factor group G/K is non-Abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is TRUE.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. ки\nStep 1: Consider K as a normal subgroup of H. ки\nStep 2: By definition, K is closed under the operation of H, meaning that for any a, b in K, a ∘ b is also in K. ки\nStep 3: Since H is a normal subgroup of G, any element of H can be written as g^(-1)hg for some g, h in G. ки\nStep 4: Consider a, b in K. We can write (a) = g^(-1)hg and (b) = f^(-1)hf for some g, h, f in G. ки\nStep 5: Using the fact that K is a normal subgroup of H, we can write (a)(b) in two different ways: (a)(b) = (g^(-1)hg)(f^(-1)hf) and (a)(b) = [g^(-1)](h)(g)([f^(-1)](h)(f)). ки\nStep 6: Since K is normal in H, the order in which we multiply the elements does not matter. This allows us to rewrite the second expression as h)((g^(-1)(f^(-1)))(h)(g)(h)(f)). ки\nStep 7: Since hg and h are both in H, the elements in the parentheses commute. Therefore, the expression becomes h(g^(-1)(f^(-1))hg(hf). ки\nStep 8: Since K is a normal subgroup of H, the expression (g^(-1)) is in K. ки\nStep 9: Therefore, g^(-1) = g^(-1) in K for any g in G. This implies that g^(-1) is in K for any g in G. ки\nStep 10: Using the same argument, we can show that f^(-1) is in K for any f in G. ки\nStep 11: Using the fact that K is a normal subgroup of H, we can write (a) = (g^(-1)hg)K and (b) = (f^(-1)hf)K for some g, h, f in G. ки\nStep 12: Since K is closed under the operation of H, the expression (a)(b) = (g^(-1)hg)(f^(-1)hf)K is in K. ки\nStep 13: Therefore, K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is TRUE.\n\nThe answer is D.",

The kernel of a ring homomorphism f: R → S is the set of all elements in R that map to 0 under f, denoted as ker(f) = f⁻¹(0) = {x ∈ R | f(x) = 0}.

In other words, a ring homomorphism is one-to-one if it preserves the \"identity\" between elements of the domain ring R. This means that for all a, b ∈ R, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b. ки\nStep 3: Now, examine Statement 1. \"A ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}\" can be rewritten as: f is one-to-one if and only if ker(f) = {0}.

Therefore, the homomorphism is one-to-one, since there is no element that maps to 0 other than the additive identity. ки\nStep 2: Now, let's show that if the homomorphism is one-to-one, then the kernel is {0}. Suppose, on the contrary, that the kernel contains an element a ≠ 0. Then, φ(a) = 0. This means that the homomorphism maps a to 0, which contradicts the assumption that the homomorphism is one-to-one. Therefore, the only element in the kernel must be 0. ки\nStep 3: Now, let's consider Statement 2: Q is an ideal in R. For Q to be an ideal, it must satisfy two properties:\n\n1. It must contain the additive identity element 0.\n2. For any element a in R and any element q in Q, a + q is also in Q.\n\nQ satisfies the first condition since it contains 0. As for the second condition, let's consider an element a in R and an element q in Q. Then, a + q = (a + q) + 0 is also in Q, since Q is an ideal. Therefore, Q is an ideal in R.\n\nStepping back, we can see that Statement 1 is true (one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}) and Statement 2 is also true (Q is an ideal in R). Therefore, the correct answer is C, True, False.",

A ring homomorphism is defined as a function f: R -> S that satisfies two conditions: (1) f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b), and (2) f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in R, and fuserIDe(1) = 1.

This is because the field L is a vector space over K, and the map L → L × L given by a → (a,0) is an isomorphism. ки\nStep 2: Note that if L/K is a field extension, the dimension of the vector space L over K is equal to the number of elements in some basis for L over K. ки\nStep 3: Let us try to find a basis for the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q. We know that Q(sqrt(2)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), since we can rationalize the denominator of an arbitrary element in Q(sqrt(2)) to remove the sqrt(3). Similarly, Q(sqrt(3)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)). We also know that Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are different because they have different characteristic polynomials (1 is the minimal polynomial for Q(sqrt(2)), while 1 is the minimal polynomial for Q(sqrt(3)), since nothing can be added to or subtracted from sqrt(3) without changing its value). ки\nStep 4: We can take the union of these two fields, Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)), to get a larger field, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). This is because the union is closed under addition and multiplication, and this field contains both Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)). ки\nStep 5: Note that the elements in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) can be written in the form a + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6), for some a, b, c, and d in Q. This is because any arbitrary linear combination of these elements will give us something in the form a + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6). ки\nStep 6: Next, we note that if a + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6) is an element in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), then we can multiply it by sqrt(2) or sqrt(3) to get other elements. This shows that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is not a vector space over Q, and therefore cannot be the field we are looking for. ки\nStep 7: In order to fix this, we will denote the element (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) by t.

The degree of this extension is 2 since sqrt(2) is irrational over Q. ки\nStep 4: Consider the field extension Q(sqrt(3)) over Q. The degree of this extension is also 2 since sqrt(3) is irrational over Q. ки\nStep 5: Notice that (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))x + 2 in Q(x). This polynomial has no roots in Q, so it is irreducible over Q. ки\nStep 6: Since the polynomial x^2 - (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))x + 2 is irreducible over Q, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is equal to the degree of the polynomial, which is 2. ки\nStep 7: Now, consider the tower of extensions Q ⊆ Q(sqrt(2)) ⊆ Q(sqrt(2)) ⊆ Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), where the last two steps are given by the Kummer extensions obtained in Steps 3 and 4. By the tower rule, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is equal to the product of the degrees of the two extensions, which is 2 × 2 = 4. ки\nStep 8: However, we have already shown in Step 6 that the degree is actually 2, not 4.

Since L/Q is a field extension, a is also a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2 in Q(x).

We want to find the zeros of this polynomial, which means we want to find the values of x such that the polynomial evaluates to 0. ки\nStep 2: In the finite field Z_7, we can reduce all coefficients of the polynomial modulo 7. This means we can divide all coefficients by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients and the modulus, which is 1 in this case.\n\nSo, the polynomial becomes: x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 is equivalent to x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 ки\nStep 3: Notice that the coefficients of the polynomial are integers, so we can plug in values for x and check if the polynomial evaluates to 0. ки\nStep 4: Let's start with x = 0:\n\nx^3 + 2x + 2 = 0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 2 (not 0) ки\nStep 5: Let's try x = 1:\n\nx^3 + 2x + 2 = 1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 3 (not 0) ки\nStep 6: Let's try x = 2:\n\nx^3 + 2x + 2 = 2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 (not 0) but mod 7: 14 ≡ 0 (mod 7) ки\nStep 7: Ah, we found a solution! x = 2 satisfies the polynomial.

We can do this by substituting x = a in the polynomial and simplifying:\n\nx^3 + 2x + 2 = a^3 + 2a + 2 ки\nStep 2: Since we're working in Z_7, we can simplify the expressions modulo 7:\n\na^3 ≡ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (mod 7) ки\nStep 3: We can start by trying a = 0:\n\na^3 + 2a + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\n\nThis doesn't seem to be a solution, since 2 is not 0 in Z_7. So, we try the next value, a = 1:\n\n1^3 + 2(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n\nThis also doesn't seem to be a solution, since 5 is not 0 in Z_7.
